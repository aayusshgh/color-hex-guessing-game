## Contribution


You always need to make a branch before starting to make changes to the code base.

**Branch Naming**

The convenction of branch naming is as follows:

1. For **feature** related work: `feature/<your-github-username>/<feature-name>`
   > feature/aayusshgh/new-feature-name
2. For **fix**/**bug** related work: `fix/<your-github-username>/<bug>`
   > fix/aayusshgh/fix-brief

**Guidelines**

 Always make PR to development branch as base branch. If you want to merge your changes in your custom branches, do it in your local git rather than populating remote git hosting servers.
- Make specific PR, no matter what create one PR of related issues or features.
- Donot make direct changes to **development** branch.
- Always test your code, before pushing it to github.
